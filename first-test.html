        <h1>Briany Gomez, My Wonderful Sister</h1>

            <p>On Wednesday, August the 5<sup>th</sup> of 2020, <br />
                she will be going to 
                
                <b>UNC Chapel Hill</b> as a freshman

            . It feels like time has passed by so quickly because 
            it feels like just yesterday she was a high school
            freshman.</p>
            
           
            <p>However, I thank God that she got accepted into one of the 
                best schools in the country and in the state. I
                couldn't be more proud of her and her accomplishments! 
                My sister and my mom are the strongest and smartest
                women that I know. 
            </p>

            <p>She is staying at a dorm called,    
                
                <i>Duke Players need H<sub>2</sub>O Because they're so bad</i> 

            which I think she made up, but I wouldn't be surprised
            if the dorm's name was actually named like that.</p>
